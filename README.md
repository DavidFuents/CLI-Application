# CLI

Hello this is my first big project with Ruby. For this project, I decided to bring Spotify Search to Command Line. Search for any artist, song or album to get back a few details related to it.

## Usage

You will need to download [`chromium`](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium). Please start a local server on terminal using `python3 -m http.server`. You will need a to make a Spotify Developer account in order to get access to a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. After getting those two things put them in the initialize method for `authorize.rb`. Install gems by running `bundle install` and finally run `bin/start` to start application. 

## License
